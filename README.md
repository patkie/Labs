Welcome to my Cybersecurity Labs Portfolio.
This repository contains 30 hands-on labs covering networking, IT fundamentals, and risk management. Each lab demonstrates real technical skills using tools such as Wireshark, Nmap, Metasploit, GNS3, SimpleRisk, Windows Server, Linux utilities, and more.

All labs are grouped into the three major areas of my cybersecurity coursework:
Fundamentals of Communication and Networking,
Fundamentals of Information Technology, and
Managing Risk in Information Systems.




Fundamentals of Communication & Networking
Labs in this section focus on network architecture, traffic analysis, routing, switching, network performance, and layered security.
Included Labs:

Analyzing Transport & Application Layer Traffic with Wireshark
Assessing the Physical and Logical Network Infrastructure
Configuring a Layer 2 Network with the Spanning Tree Protocol
Configuring a Layer 3 Network with Dynamic Routing Protocols
Configuring an SNMP Manager and Alerts
Designing a Network Topology with GNS3
Implementing a Layered Security Solution on the Network
Monitoring and Assessing Network Performance
Troubleshooting Common Network Issues



Fundamentals of Information Technology
These labs focus on authentication, encryption, vulnerability scanning, incident response, logging, policy enforcement, and secure system administration.
